ros-melodic-mir-gazebo (1.0.3-0bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Add hector_mapping
  * fake_localization.launch: Add frame id args
  * Merge pull request #16 <https://github.com/dfki-ric/mir_robot/issues/16> from niniemann/add-prefix-argument-to-configs
    Add prefix argument to configs
  * adds $(arg prefix) to a lot of configs
    This is an important step to be able to re-parameterize move base,
    the diffdrive controller, ekf, amcl and the costmaps for adding a
    tf prefix to the robots links
  * Fix translation error in odom_comb (#12 <https://github.com/dfki-ric/mir_robot/issues/12>)
    Previously, the ekf localization only computed a correct orientation, but the translation still followed the pure odometry data. This led to strange errors where the robot would move sideways (despite only having a diff drive).
    This PR changes the ekf configuration to not use any position information from the odometry, but to integrate the velocities, which fixes this problem.
  * Split scan_rep117 topic into two separate topics
    This fixes the problem that the back laser scanner was ignored in the
    navigation costmap in Gazebo (probably because in Gazebo, both laser
    scanners have the exact same timestamp).
